# volatility-research-project
An R project validating the Component GARCH (CGARCH) model for risk management. The study first develops and invalidates a novel ARMA-driven GARCH, then proves the superiority of the CGARCH-t model in Value-at-Risk backtests where standard GARCH-t fails. Complete methodology and backtesting framework included.
