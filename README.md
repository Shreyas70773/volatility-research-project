## Research Evolution and Objectives

### The Original Question
**Can we improve volatility forecasting by making the GARCH baseline parameter dynamic rather than constant?**

### Extended Research Framework
The project has evolved into a comprehensive volatility modeling ecosystem addressing:

1. **Dynamic Baseline Volatility:** Time-varying intercept parameters in GARCH models
2. **Machine Learning Integration:** XGBoost-enhanced volatility forecasting
3. **High-Frequency Integration:** Realized volatility and HAR models
4. **Multi-Asset Modeling:** Dynamic conditional correlations and portfolio applications
5. **Risk Management Validation:** Industry-standard VaR backtesting across multiple models

---


## Theoretical Background

### Standard GARCH(1,1) Model

The baseline GARCH(1,1) model for conditional variance is:

```
σ²_t = ω + α ε²_{t-1} + β σ²_{t-1}
```

**Where:**
- `σ²_t` = conditional variance at time t
- `ω` = constant intercept (baseline volatility)
- `α` = ARCH parameter (reaction to shocks)
- `β` = GARCH parameter (volatility persistence)
- `ε²_{t-1}` = squared innovation from previous period

**Long-run unconditional variance:**
```
σ²_∞ = ω / (1 - α - β)
```

**Stationarity condition:** `α + β < 1`

### Limitations of Standard GARCH

1. **Constant Long-run Variance:** The parameter ω implies a fixed baseline volatility level
2. **Regime Insensitivity:** Cannot adapt to structural changes in market conditions
3. **Static Risk Assessment:** Long-run risk level remains constant regardless of economic conditions

### Two-Pass ARMA-GARCH Methodology

Traditional approach for separating mean and variance dynamics:

**Pass 1 - Mean Equation (ARMA):**
```
R_t = μ + φ₁R_{t-1} + θ₁a_{t-1} + a_t
```

**Pass 2 - Variance Equation (GARCH on residuals):**
```
σ²_t = ω + α a²_{t-1} + β σ²_{t-1}
```

Where `a_t` are the residuals from the mean equation.

---

## Phase 1: Dynamic GARCH Innovation

### 1.1 Core Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:** The GARCH intercept ω should be time-varying and driven by a separate ARMA process modeling the dynamics of squared residuals.

### 1.2 The Three-Stage ARMA-Driven Dynamic GARCH Model

#### Stage 1: Mean Equation
```
R_t = μ + φ₁R_{t-1} + θ₁a_{t-1} + a_t
```

**Purpose:** Capture serial correlation in returns and extract residuals `a_t`

#### Stage 2: Variance Innovation Equation
```
log(a²_t + c) = ω_A + α_A log(a²_{t-1} + c) + β_A v_{t-1} + v_t
```

**Key Features:**
- **Log transformation:** Ensures positivity and stabilizes variance
- **Small constant c:** Prevents log(0) numerical issues
- **ARMA(1,1) structure:** Captures complex patterns in variance evolution

**Theoretical Justification:**
- Models the time-varying component of baseline volatility
- Captures long-memory effects in volatility clustering
- Provides one-step-ahead forecasts for dynamic intercept

#### Stage 3: Dynamic GARCH Equation
```
ω_t = E_{t-1}[exp(ω_A + α_A log(a²_{t-1} + c) + β_A v_{t-1}) - c]
```

```
σ²_t = ω_t + α_G a²_{t-1} + β_G σ²_{t-1}
```

**Theoretical Appeal:**
- **Adaptive baseline:** ω_t changes with market conditions
- **Regime sensitivity:** Model automatically adjusts to different risk environments
- **Unified framework:** Combines ARMA pattern recognition with GARCH efficiency

### 1.3 Mathematical Properties

#### Long-run Variance Consistency

For model consistency, both approaches should yield the same long-run variance:

**ARMA long-run variance:**
```
σ²_∞(ARMA) = ω_A / (1 - α_A)
```

**GARCH long-run variance:**
```
σ²_∞(GARCH) = E[ω_t] / (1 - α_G - β_G)
```

**Linking condition:**
```
ω_A / (1 - α_A) = E[ω_t] / (1 - α_G - β_G)
```

#### Bias Correction for Log Transformation

**Jensen's Inequality Problem:**
```
E[exp(X)] ≠ exp(E[X])
```

**Bias correction formula:**
```
E[exp(X)] = exp(E[X] + Var(X)/2)
```

Applied to our case:
```
ω_t = exp(ω_A + α_A log(a²_{t-1} + c) + β_A v_{t-1} + σ²_v/2) - c
```

---

## Phase 2: Empirical Testing and Diagnostic Analysis

### 2.1 Backtesting Methodology

#### Performance Metrics

**1. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):**
```
RMSE = sqrt(1/T × Σ(σ²_{t,realized} - σ²_{t,forecast})²)
```

**2. Diebold-Mariano Test for Forecast Accuracy:**
```
H₀: E[d_t] = 0
d_t = L(e_{1,t}) - L(e_{2,t})
```
Where `L(e_{i,t})` is the loss function for model i.

**3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**
```
MAE = 1/T × Σ|σ²_{t,realized} - σ²_{t,forecast}|
```

#### Out-of-Sample Testing Framework

- **Training Period:** First 80% of sample
- **Testing Period:** Remaining 20% of sample
- **Rolling Window:** 1000-observation estimation window
- **Forecast Horizons:** 1-day and 10-day ahead
- **Volatility Proxy:** Daily squared returns (a²_t) are used as the proxy for realized variance, a standard approach in the GARCH literature.

### 2.2 Empirical Findings: The Failure

#### Performance Results

**Diebold-Mariano Test Results:**
- **1-day forecasts:** p-value > 0.70
- **10-day forecasts:** p-value > 0.65
- **Interpretation:** No statistically significant difference from standard GARCH

**RMSE Comparison:**
- **Dynamic GARCH:** Marginally worse than standard GARCH
- **Conclusion:** The added complexity provided no forecasting benefit. While standard for capturing mean and variance dynamics separately, this sequential approach can lead to bias accumulation and is not designed to decompose the variance into its underlying frequency components.

  Systematic demonstration of the theoretical and empirical failure of a novel ARMA-driven dynamic GARCH approach
  
### 2.3 Diagnostic Analysis: Uncovering the Fundamental Flaw

#### Critical Diagnostic Discoveries

**1. Massive Scale Misalignment**
```
Mean(ω_t) ≈ 30 × ω_benchmark
```
**Translation:** The dynamic intercept was operating on a completely different scale

**2. The "Spikiness" Problem**

**Expected behavior:** ω_t should be smooth, slow-moving baseline
**Actual behavior:** ω_t was highly volatile, resembling daily volatility patterns

**Diagnostic plot reveals:**
- High correlation between ω_t and daily volatility
- Frequent dramatic spikes in baseline level
- No clear trend or regime-based evolution

**3. Double-Counting of Short-term Dynamics**

**The Core Problem:** ARMA on a²_t captures the same short-term volatility clustering that GARCH is designed to model.

**Mathematical Explanation:**
```
a²_t = σ²_t × z²_t
```
Where `z_t ~ iid(0,1)`. When we model a²_t with ARMA, we're modeling:
```
σ²_t × z²_t = ω_A + α_A (σ²_{t-1} × z²_{t-1}) + β_A v_{t-1} + v_t
```

This creates confounding between the true volatility dynamics (σ²_t) and the random shocks (z²_t).

#### Theoretical Diagnosis: Why ARMA-on-Residuals Fails

**Fundamental Issue:** Inability to decompose variance into frequency components

**The residuals a²_t contain:**
- High-frequency noise (z²_t effects)
- Medium-frequency volatility clustering
- Low-frequency regime changes

**ARMA models all three together, cannot isolate the baseline component we need.**

---

## Phase 3: Component GARCH Framework

### 3.1 Theoretical Pivot

Based on diagnostic findings, research pivoted to Component GARCH (CGARCH) model of Engle and Lee (1999), which explicitly addresses the dynamic baseline volatility problem through proper mathematical decomposition.

### 3.2 Component GARCH Model Specification

#### Variance Decomposition

**Total conditional variance:**
```
σ²_t = q_t + (σ²_t - q_t)
```

Where:
- `q_t` = permanent component (time-varying long-run variance)
- `(σ²_t - q_t)` = transitory component (short-run deviations)

#### Long-run Component Equation
```
q_t = ω + ρ(q_{t-1} - ω) + φ(a²_{t-1} - σ²_{t-1})
```

**Parameter Interpretations:**
- `ω` = long-run average variance level
- `ρ` = persistence of long-run component (typically ρ ≈ 0.99)
- `φ` = adjustment speed based on variance surprises
- `(a²_{t-1} - σ²_{t-1})` = variance forecast error (surprise component)

#### Short-run Component Equation
```
σ²_t = q_t + α(a²_{t-1} - q_{t-1}) + β(σ²_{t-1} - q_{t-1})
```

**Parameter Interpretations:**
- `α` = reaction to transitory shocks
- `β` = persistence of transitory component
- Mean reversion target is `q_t` (time-varying), not constant ω

### 3.3 Why CGARCH Solves the Original Problem

#### 1. Proper Frequency Decomposition
- **High ρ (≈0.99):** Forces q_t to be smooth, slow-moving
- **Low φ:** Gradual adjustment to regime changes
- **Solves spikiness problem** from original approach

#### 2. Correct Scale Relationships
- **Joint MLE estimation:** Ensures all parameters are on consistent scales
- **No calibration failures** like the ARMA approach

#### 3. Theoretical Coherence
- **Unified framework:** All dynamics estimated simultaneously
- **Economically interpretable:** Clear separation of short-run vs. long-run effects

### 3.4 Relationship to Original Dynamic ω Concept

The CGARCH model achieves the original research objective through mathematically superior means:

**Original concept:** σ²_t = ω_t + α ε²_{t-1} + β σ²_{t-1}
**CGARCH realization:** σ²_t = q_t + α(a²_{t-1} - q_{t-1}) + β(σ²_{t-1} - q_{t-1})

**Key insight:** q_t serves as the dynamic baseline, but with proper mathematical constraints ensuring smooth evolution.

### 4.1 XGBoost-GARCH Framework

**Methodology:** Two-stage approach combining machine learning volatility forecasts with GARCH dynamics.

#### Stage 1: ML Volatility Prediction

Target: Realized_Volatility_{t+1:t+20}
Model: XGBoost(max_depth=4, eta=0.1, subsample=0.8)
```

#### Stage 2: GARCH-X Model
```
σ²_t = ω + α ε²_{t-1} + β σ²_{t-1} + γ ML_Pred_t
```

**Where:**
- `ML_Pred_t` = XGBoost volatility forecast
- `γ` = external regressor coefficient

### 4.2 Empirical Results

**Model Comparison (AIC):**
- **GARCH-X:** 2.5202
- **Standard GARCH:** 2.5193
- **AIC Improvement:** -0.0008

**Analysis:** While the ML enhancement shows marginal performance differences, the framework demonstrates successful integration of machine learning forecasts into traditional volatility models.

---

## Phase 5: High-Frequency Data Integration

### 5.1 HAR-RV Model Implementation

**Heterogeneous Autoregressive Realized Volatility Model:**
```
RV_t = β₀ + β_d RV_{t-1} + β_w RV_weekly_{t-1} + β_m RV_monthly_{t-1} + ε_t
```

### 5.2 Empirical Results

**HAR Model Performance:**
- **R-squared:** 92.91%
- **Daily component (β_d):** 0.866*** (highly significant)
- **Weekly component (β_w):** 0.093*** (significant)
- **Monthly component (β_m):** 0.013 (not significant)

**GARCH-RV Model:**
- **AIC:** 2.5117 (best performing model)
- **Interpretation:** Realized volatility provides superior information for variance forecasting

|-------|------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Standard GARCH | 12/500 | 2.40% | 1.00% | 2.40 | Too Conservative |
| GARCH(1,1) | 14/500 | 2.80% | 1.00% | 2.80 | Too Conservative |
| eGARCH | 13/500 | 2.60% | 1.00% | 2.60 | Too Conservative |
| **Component GARCH** | **11/500** | **2.20%** | **1.00%** | **2.20** | **Best Performance** |

### 7.3 Statistical Test Results

**All models failed the Kupiec and Christoffersen tests (p < 0.05):**
- **Interpretation:** Models are systematically too conservative
- **Implication:** Need for more aggressive risk estimation or different distributional assumptions
- **Best Performer:** Component GARCH showed lowest violation rate among failing models
