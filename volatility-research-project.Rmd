# ## Step 1: Introduction and Project Setup
#
# This document details the empirical research process for developing a superior volatility forecasting model. The journey begins with a plausible but flawed hypothesis, uses rigorous diagnostics to uncover the model's failings, and pivots to a theoretically sound Component GARCH (CGARCH) model. The final analysis tests the models on the practical application of Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation.
#
# First, we load the necessary libraries and prepare the S&P 500 data that will be used throughout the analysis.

# ```{r data_preparation}
# --- 1.1: Load Libraries ---
library(quantmod)
library(forecast)
library(rugarch)
library(dplyr)

# --- 1.2: Data Acquisition and Preparation ---
cat("Downloading S&P 500 data from 2010 to present...\n")
getSymbols("^GSPC", src = "yahoo", from = "2010-01-01", to = Sys.Date())
returns <- dailyReturn(GSPC, type = "log") * 100
returns <- returns[-1, ]
colnames(returns) <- "returns"

cat("Using", nrow(returns), "observations.\n")
n_total <- nrow(returns)
n_train <- floor(n_total * 0.7)
n_test <- n_total - n_train
cat("Training set size:", n_train, "\n")
cat("Testing set size:", n_test, "\n")
# ```

# ## Step 2: The Failure of the Normal Distribution for Risk Management
#
# Before testing our main hypothesis, we must establish a baseline and demonstrate a core principle of financial risk modeling: the assumption of a Normal (Gaussian) distribution for market shocks is flawed. We will run a VaR backtest on two models—Standard GARCH and Component GARCH—both assuming a Normal distribution.
#
# **Hypothesis:** Both models will fail the backtest because the Normal distribution has "thin tails" and cannot account for the frequency of extreme events in financial markets.

# ```{r var_backtest_normal}
# --- 2.1: Define Estimation Functions (with Normal Distribution) ---
estimate_cgarch_norm <- function(data) {
  spec <- ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = "csGARCH"), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(1, 1)), distribution.model = "norm")
  tryCatch({ ugarchfit(spec = spec, data = data, solver = "hybrid") }, error = function(e) NULL)
}

estimate_sgarch_norm <- function(data) {
  spec <- ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = "sGARCH"), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(1, 1)), distribution.model = "norm")
  tryCatch({ ugarchfit(spec = spec, data = data, solver = "hybrid") }, error = function(e) NULL)
}

                           VaR_CGARCH = NA, VaR_Standard = NA)

  window_data <- returns[1:(n_train + t - 1), ]

  }

  if (!is.null(fit_sgarch)) {
    fc_sgarch <- ugarchforecast(fit_sgarch, n.ahead = 1)
    results_norm$VaR_Standard[t] <- quantile(fc_sgarch, probs = VAR_ALPHA)
  }
  if(t %% 100 == 0) cat("Normal VaR Backtest Progress:", t, "/", n_test, "\n")
}
results_norm <- na.omit(results_norm)

# --- 2.3: Analyze and Interpret the VaR Results ---
cat("\n--- VaR Backtest Results (Normal Distribution) ---\n")
vartest_cgarch_norm <- VaRTest(alpha = VAR_ALPHA, actual = results_norm$Actual_Return, VaR = results_norm$VaR_CGARCH)
vartest_sgarch_norm <- VaRTest(alpha = VAR_ALPHA, actual = results_norm$Actual_Return, VaR = results_norm$VaR_Standard)

print("CGARCH with Normal Distribution:")
print(vartest_cgarch_norm)
print("Standard GARCH with Normal Distribution:")
print(vartest_sgarch_norm)
# ```

# ### Interpretation of Step 2
#
# As hypothesized, the results are a spectacular failure for both models.
#
# *   **Component GARCH (Normal):** Produced 27 breaches when only ~12 were expected. It **FAILS** both the Kupiec test (p-value ~0.0001) for the correct number of breaches and the Christoffersen test (p-value ~0.0006) for independence.
# *   **Standard GARCH (Normal):** Performed similarly, with 28 breaches, also **FAILING** both tests decisively.
#
# **Conclusion:** The assumption of a Normal distribution is invalid for risk management. It systematically underestimates tail risk, leading to unreliable models. This motivates the use of a fat-tailed distribution for all subsequent tests.

# ## Step 3: The Definitive VaR Backtest (with Student's t-Distribution)
#
# Having established the need for a fat-tailed distribution, we now conduct the definitive test of the project. We will compare the Component GARCH against the Standard GARCH, with both models correctly specified using the Student's t-distribution.
#
# **Hypothesis:** The superior theoretical structure of the CGARCH model, combined with the correct distributional assumption, will allow it to pass the VaR backtests while the Standard GARCH model may still exhibit flaws.

# ```{r var_backtest_student_t}
# --- 3.1: Define Estimation Functions (with Student's t-Distribution) ---
estimate_cgarch_std <- function(data) {
  spec <- ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = "csGARCH"), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(1, 1)), distribution.model = "std")
  tryCatch({ ugarchfit(spec = spec, data = data, solver = "hybrid") }, error = function(e) NULL)
}

estimate_sgarch_std <- function(data) {
  spec <- ugarchspec(variance.model = list(model = "sGARCH"), mean.model = list(armaOrder = c(1, 1)), distribution.model = "std")
  tryCatch({ ugarchfit(spec = spec, data = data, solver = "hybrid") }, error = function(e) NULL)
}

# --- 3.2: Run the VaR Backtest Loop (Student's t-Distribution) ---
results_std <- data.frame(Date = index(returns)[(n_train + 1):n_total],
                          Actual_Return = coredata(returns)[(n_train + 1):n_total],
                          VaR_CGARCH = NA, VaR_Standard = NA)

for (t in 1:n_test) {
  window_data <- returns[1:(n_train + t - 1), ]
  
  fit_cgarch <- estimate_cgarch_std(window_data)
  if (!is.null(fit_cgarch)) {
    fc_cgarch <- ugarchforecast(fit_cgarch, n.ahead = 1)
    results_std$VaR_CGARCH[t] <- quantile(fc_cgarch, probs = VAR_ALPHA)
  }
  
  fit_sgarch <- estimate_sgarch_std(window_data)
  if (!is.null(fit_sgarch)) {
    fc_sgarch <- ugarchforecast(fit_sgarch, n.ahead = 1)
    results_std$VaR_Standard[t] <- quantile(fc_sgarch, probs = VAR_ALPHA)
  }
  if(t %% 100 == 0) cat("Student's t VaR Backtest Progress:", t, "/", n_test, "\n")
}
results_std <- na.omit(results_std)

# --- 3.3: Analyze and Interpret the VaR Results ---
cat("\n--- VaR Backtest Results (Student's t-Distribution) ---\n")
vartest_cgarch_std <- VaRTest(alpha = VAR_ALPHA, actual = results_std$Actual_Return, VaR = results_std$VaR_CGARCH)
vartest_sgarch_std <- VaRTest(alpha = VAR_ALPHA, actual = results_std$Actual_Return, VaR = results_std$VaR_Standard)

print("CGARCH with Student's t-Distribution:")
print(vartest_cgarch_std)
print("Standard GARCH with Student's t-Distribution:")
print(vartest_sgarch_std)
# ```

# ### Interpretation of Step 3
#
# The results from this definitive test are a clear and powerful conclusion to the project.
#
# *   **Component GARCH (Student's t):** With 17 breaches (expected ~12), the model **PASSES** both the Kupiec test (p-value = 0.155) and the crucial Christoffersen test (p-value = 0.183). The number of breaches is statistically correct, and they are not clustered. **This is a valid and reliable risk model.**
# *   **Standard GARCH (Student's t):** With 20 breaches, the model **FAILS** the Kupiec test (p-value = 0.029). While it barely passes the Christoffersen test, its failure to produce the correct number of exceptions makes it an unreliable risk model.
#
# **Conclusion:** This provides the final, crucial piece of evidence. The superior theoretical structure of the CGARCH model, which allows it to adapt to different long-run risk regimes, is the decisive factor that allows it to produce reliable risk estimates where the simpler standard GARCH model fails.

# ## Step 4: Visual and Economic Interpretation
#
# The final step is to visualize the results to build intuition. We will plot the successful VaR backtest and then examine the long-run component (`q_t`) from the CGARCH model to see if it provides a sensible economic interpretation of the market environment.

# ```{r final_plots}
# --- 4.1: Plot the Successful VaR Backtest (with robust ylim fix) ---

# Re-create the xts object just to be safe
results_xts <- xts(results_std[, -1], order.by = results_std$Date)

# *** THE FIX: Manually calculate the y-axis limits from ALL data to be plotted ***
# This finds the absolute minimum and maximum across the actual returns and both VaR forecasts.
plot_ylim <- range(
  c(results_xts$Actual_Return, results_xts$VaR_CGARCH, results_xts$VaR_Standard), 
  na.rm = TRUE
)

# Reset plot margins to avoid the other common plot error
par(mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)

# Now create the plot using our manually defined ylim
plot(results_xts$Actual_Return, type = "l", col = "gray80", 
     main = "99% VaR Backtest with Student's t-Distribution",
     xlab = "Date", ylab = "Daily Return (%)",
     ylim = plot_ylim) # Use the calculated ylim here

lines(results_xts$VaR_CGARCH, col = "blue", lwd = 1.5)
lines(results_xts$VaR_Standard, col = "red", lty = "dashed", lwd = 1.5)

# Add points for breaches

       legend = c("Actual Returns", "CGARCH VaR (PASS)", "Standard VaR (FAIL)", "CGARCH Breach", "Standard Breach"), 
       col = c("gray80", "blue", "red", "blue", "red"), 
       lty = c(1, 1, 2, NA, NA), 
       pch = c(NA, NA, NA, 19, 1), 
       bty = "n")


# --- 4.2: Analyze the Long-Run Component (q_t) ---
cat("\n--- Analyzing the Long-Run Component q_t ---\n")
final_cgarch_model_std <- estimate_cgarch_std(returns)

if(!is.null(final_cgarch_model_std)) {
  final_q_t <- xts(final_cgarch_model_std@fit$q, order.by = index(returns))
  
  plot(final_q_t, main="In-Sample Long-Run Component (q_t) from CGARCH-t Model",
       ylab="Long-Run Variance (q_t)", xlab="Date")
       
  # Compare to standard GARCH unconditional variance
  final_sgarch_model_std <- estimate_sgarch_std(returns)
  coefs <- coef(final_sgarch_model_std)
  uncond_var_std <- coefs["omega"] / (1 - coefs["alpha1"] - coefs["beta1"])
  
  cat("Average value of long-run q_t:", mean(final_q_t), "\n")
  cat("Standard GARCH-t unconditional variance:", as.numeric(uncond_var_std), "\n")
}
# ```

# ### Interpretation of Step 4
#
# The final plots provide a clear visual summary of the project's findings.
#
# *   **VaR Plot:** The plot clearly shows the wider, more conservative VaR boundaries produced by the models with the Student's t-distribution. We can visually confirm the lower number of breaches compared to the previous failed models.
# *   **Long-Run Component Plot:** The `q_t` series is a smooth, slowly evolving measure of the market's baseline risk level. It correctly identifies the high-risk regime following the 2020 crisis and the calmer periods thereafter. Crucially, its average value is well-calibrated and on the same scale as the unconditional variance of the standard GARCH model, confirming that the CGARCH model is working as theoretically intended.
#
# **Grand Conclusion:** A successful risk model requires both a correct structure for volatility dynamics (which CGARCH provides) and a correct assumption for the distribution of shocks (which the Student's t-distribution provides). The combination of these two elements creates a model that is statistically valid, practically useful, and economically interpretable.
